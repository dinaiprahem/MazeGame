actor(player) , functions(verbs) , class names(nouns)
classes : player , maze , arrow keys , exit, walls , empty space
layout, character , @symbol, position

methods : move,display

*interface : Imaze object --> عنصر من عناصر اللعبه ممكن يكون حيطه او مساحه او اللاعب readOnly(the wall not change to space so it get only cant use set in its property)

*relation: dashed line with empty arrow

*wall , empty space ,character implement the interface

*maze : has a collection of IMaze objects ( collection of walls,empty spaces )
so relatioon in aggregation (1..*) one maze have many objects

*layout is the maze;    

*exit is the empty space where te character move and exit 

*player is character is the symbol

*draw the maze ( display method is in maze ) , fields (width , height );

*when move i take different position so move and position have a relation
move responsible in maze with arrow keys;

*in maze object there is icon ( solid or space or player)

*movementBlock (is solid true or false)--> وونا بلعب لاما همشي في فراغ لاما هخبط ف الحيطه هنسميها سوليد لان لو هي سوليد مش هيعرف اللاعب يعدي لو مش سوليد هيعرف يعدي
